- structured query language allowing for query, manipulation, and data transformation from relational db and due to simplicity - sql dbs provide safe, scalable storage for several sites, mobile apps
    - popular dbs = sqlite, mysql, pg, oracle, ms sql server
    - rdbm = collection of related 2d tables with fixed # of columns (attributes/properties), data rows
    - sql allows one ot understand and answer specific questions 'what type of cars on road currently have < 4 wheels', 'how many models of cars prod by Tesla'

    | id | model | # wheels | # doors | type |
    | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
    | 1 | ford | 4 | 2 | sedan |
    | 2 | tesla | 4 | 2 | sports |
